# neural-network-challenge-2
Module_19_Challenge

__Purpose__: In this Challenge we display knowledge of branching in nueral network models looking a attrition data for a company
  
    
&nbsp; &nbsp; __Step 1__: Preprocess the data
&nbsp; &nbsp; __Step 2__: CCreate, Compile, and Train the Model  
&nbsp; &nbsp;__Step 3__: Provide a summary and answer questions regarding the model and selections

__Intalls__: A number of installations are needed (and provided) to run the code necessary to complete this project  
  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras import layers
